## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Page doesn't open
**Symptoms:** Browser shows error or blank page

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure JavaScript is enabled:
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy and security → Site Settings → JavaScript → Allowed
   - Firefox: about:config → javascript.enabled → true
   - Edge: Settings → Cookies and site permissions → JavaScript → Allowed

2. Try different browser (Chrome recommended)

3. Check file location (should not be in restricted folder)

### Problem: "Generate Excel Report" doesn't work
**Symptoms:** Button click doesn't download file or shows error

**Solutions:**
1. Check internet connection (needs to load SheetJS library)

2. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R / Cmd+R)

3. Check browser console:
   - Press F12
   - Look for red errors
   - Common issue: CDN blocked by ad blocker

4. Allow pop-ups and downloads in browser settings

5. Try incognito/private mode (rules out extension conflicts)

### Problem: Metrics not updating
**Symptoms:** Timestamp doesn't change, values static

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh page (F5)

2. Clear browser cache:
   - Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Clear data

3. Check that page is still in focus (updates pause when tab inactive)

### Problem: Data not saving
**Symptoms:** Values reset when page reloads

**Solutions:**
1. Enable cookies and site data:
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy and security → Cookies → Allow all
   - LocalStorage requires cookies to be enabled

2. Check browser is not in Incognito/Private mode

3. Ensure not using "Clear data on exit" setting

### Problem: Excel generation shows error
**Symptoms:** Alert says "SheetJS library not loaded"

**Solutions:**
1. **Check internet connection** - Library loads from CDN

2. **Disable ad blockers** - May block cdn.sheetjs.com

3. **Try different network** - Corporate networks may block CDN

4. **Wait and retry** - Network may be slow

5. **Use Python version** - If browser version impossible

## 🌐 Network Configuration

### For Corporate Networks

If SheetJS CDN is blocked:

**Option 1: Request Whitelist**
Ask IT to whitelist: `cdn.sheetjs.com`

**Option 2: Local Hosting**
1. Download SheetJS from https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.20.0/package/dist/xlsx.full.min.js
2. Save as `xlsx.full.min.js` in same folder as `index.html`
3. Edit `index.html` line 8:
   ```html
   <!-- Change from: -->
   <script src="https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.20.0/package/dist/xlsx.full.min.js"></script>
   
   <!-- To: -->
   <script src="xlsx.full.min.js"></script>
   ```

**Option 3: Use Python Version**
Run `generate_ecom_tracking_system.py` instead (see Legacy Setup below)

### For Offline Use

After first successful load:
1. Browser caches SheetJS library
2. Dashboard continues working offline
3. Excel generation works offline
4. Only initial load requires internet

## 🔄 Alternative Setup: Python (Legacy)

✅ No admin rights required
✅ No network changes needed
✅ Audit trail in browser history

## 📈 Scaling Considerations

### Single User
✅ Works perfectly out of the box
- LocalStorage sufficient
- No performance issues

### Small Team (2-10 users)
✅ Each user runs own copy
- Share files via email/network
- No central server needed

### Large Team (10+ users)
⚠️ Consider enhancements:
- Central server for shared data
- Database instead of LocalStorage
- Real-time synchronization
- See IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md for details

## 🎁 Bonus: HTTP Server (Optional)

For advanced users who want to serve over HTTP:

### Python HTTP Server
```bash
cd Ecom-Investigation
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Open http://localhost:8080/index.html
```

### Node.js HTTP Server
```bash
npx http-server -p 8080
# Open http://localhost:8080/index.html
```

**Note:** Not required! Double-clicking index.html works fine.
