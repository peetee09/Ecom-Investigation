### Download and Open

**The file is ready to use - no generation needed!**

1. **Download** `Ecom_Operations_Tracking_System_Formula_Based.xlsx` from the repository
2. **Open** in Microsoft Excel, Excel Online, LibreOffice Calc, or Google Sheets
3. **Start using** immediately - all formulas are pre-loaded!

### Using the File

1. **No macros to enable** - Start using immediately!
2. **View Dashboard** - See live KPI calculations
3. **Read instructions** - Each sheet has a "HOW TO USE" row (row 3) with light blue background
4. **Enter data** in tracking sheets - Dashboard updates automatically
5. **Copy formulas** - Use sample formulas in row 4 as templates
6. **All formulas work instantly** - No VBA, no code, no complexity

### For Developers: Regenerating the File

If you want to modify and regenerate the Excel file:

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install openpyxl

# Generate the formula-based Excel file
python3 create_formula_based_excel.py
```

This creates a fresh: `Ecom_Operations_Tracking_System_Formula_Based.xlsx`

## 📈 How It Works

### Automatic KPI Calculations

The Dashboard pulls data from all tracking sheets and calculates KPIs in real-time:

1. **Wave Completion Rate**: Counts waves completed within 60 minutes vs total completed
2. **Training Completion**: Counts completed training vs total employees
3. **Stock Replenishment Time**: Averages duration from Stock Replenishment sheet
4. **Quality Coverage**: Averages coverage percentages from Quality Audit sheet
5. **Picking Efficiency**: Averages efficiency from Picking Tasks sheet
6. **Inventory Accuracy**: Calculates based on variance data

### Dynamic Status Indicators

Status cells use IF formulas to show:
- **Excellent** / **On Track** - Meeting or exceeding targets
- **Good** / **Acceptable** - Within acceptable range
- **Needs Attention** / **Delayed** - Below target but not critical
- **Critical** - Urgent attention required

Example:
```excel
=IF(C6>=0.95,"On Track",IF(C6>=0.85,"Needs Attention","Critical"))
```

### Duration Calculations

Time-based tracking automatically calculates:
- Wave completion times in minutes
- Stock replenishment times in hours
- Picking task times in minutes

All using Excel's date/time arithmetic:
```excel
Duration = (End Time - Start Time) * 24 * 60  // for minutes
Duration = (End Time - Start Time) * 24        // for hours
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Data

Simply add rows to any tracking sheet:
- Formulas will automatically extend
- Dashboard will include new data in calculations
- No manual updates needed

### Modifying Formulas

All formulas are visible and editable:
1. Click on any formula cell
2. View formula in formula bar
3. Edit as needed
4. Press Enter to save

### Adjusting Thresholds

Change target thresholds in Dashboard status formulas:
```excel
// Change 0.95 threshold to 0.90 for 90% target
=IF(C6>=0.90,"On Track",IF(C6>=0.80,"Needs Attention","Critical"))
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### Data Entry

1. **Use consistent formats** - Dates, times, and statuses should be consistent
2. **Don't delete header rows** - Formulas reference specific rows
3. **Add data sequentially** - Add new rows at the bottom
4. **Validate inputs** - Check data types match expected formats

### Performance

1. **Avoid excessive rows** - Keep data to current/recent periods
2. **Archive old data** - Move historical data to separate sheets
3. **Limit formula ranges** - Use specific ranges instead of entire columns when possible
4. **Disable auto-calculation** (if needed) - For very large datasets

### Maintenance

1. **Regular backups** - Save copies before major changes
2. **Document changes** - Note any formula modifications
3. **Test formulas** - Verify calculations after changes
4. **Review references** - Ensure formulas reference correct sheets/cells

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Formulas Show #REF! Error

**Cause:** Referenced sheet or cell was deleted
**Solution:** Check formula references, restore deleted sheet/data if needed

### Formulas Show #DIV/0! Error

**Cause:** Division by zero (no data in denominator)
**Solution:** Add data to referenced sheet, or modify formula to handle empty data

### Formulas Show #VALUE! Error

**Cause:** Wrong data type (text instead of number)
**Solution:** Check data types in referenced cells, convert text to numbers if needed

### KPIs Not Updating

**Cause:** Calculation mode set to Manual
**Solution:** Go to Formulas → Calculation Options → Automatic

### Date/Time Calculations Wrong

**Cause:** Incorrect date/time format
**Solution:** Format cells as Date or Time, ensure consistent date format
