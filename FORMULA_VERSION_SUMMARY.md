## üìä Features Implemented

### Dashboard Sheet
**Live KPI Calculations with Formulas:**

1. **Wave Completion Rate**
   ```excel
   =COUNTIFS('Wave Tracking'!H:H,"Complete",'Wave Tracking'!E:E,"<=60")/COUNTIF('Wave Tracking'!H:H,"Complete")
   ```
   - Counts waves completed within 60 minutes
   - Divides by total completed waves
   - Result: Percentage of on-time completions

2. **Employee Training Completion**
   ```excel
   =COUNTIF('Employee Training'!G:G,"Completed")/COUNTA('Employee Training'!A:A)-1
   ```
   - Counts employees with completed training
   - Divides by total employees
   - Result: Training completion rate

3. **Stock Replenishment Time**
   ```excel
   =AVERAGE('Stock Replenishment'!I:I)
   ```
   - Averages duration column
   - Result: Average replenishment time

4. **Quality Audit Coverage**
   ```excel
   =AVERAGE('Quality Audit'!F:F)
   ```
   - Averages coverage percentages
   - Result: Overall audit coverage

5. **Picking Efficiency**
   ```excel
   =AVERAGE('Picking Tasks'!I:I)
   ```
   - Averages efficiency percentages
   - Result: Overall picking efficiency

6. **Inventory Accuracy**
   ```excel
   =1-ABS(SUM('Inventory Mismatch'!G:G))/SUM('Inventory Mismatch'!E:E)
   ```
   - Calculates total variance vs system count
   - Subtracts from 100% for accuracy
   - Result: Inventory accuracy percentage

**Dynamic Status Indicators:**
```excel
=IF(C6>=0.95,"On Track",IF(C6>=0.85,"Needs Attention","Critical"))
```
- Changes based on KPI value
- Shows "On Track", "Needs Attention", or "Critical"

**Daily Summary with Formulas:**
- Total Orders Today: `=SUM('Order Volumes'!B3:B3)`
- Active Employees: `=COUNTA('Employee Performance'!A:A)-1`
- Pending Tasks: `=COUNTIF('Wave Tracking'!H:H,"In Progress")+COUNTIF('Picking Tasks'!K:K,"In Progress")`
- System Alerts: `=COUNTIF('System Errors'!J:J,"Open")`

**Critical Alerts with Dynamic Messages:**
```excel
=IF(C8>2,"Stock replenishment time exceeding target by "&TEXT((C8-2)/2,"0%"),"")
```

### Wave Tracking Sheet
**Duration Formula:**
```excel
=(Actual End - Start Time) * 24 * 60
```
- Calculates difference in days
- Multiplies by 24 hours and 60 minutes
- Result: Duration in minutes

### Stock Replenishment Sheet
**Duration Formula:**
```excel
=(Received Time - Request Time) * 24
```
- Calculates difference in days
- Multiplies by 24 hours
- Result: Duration in hours

### Quality Audit Sheet
**Coverage Formula:**
```excel
=Items Audited / Items Processed
```
- Divides audited items by total processed
- Result: Audit coverage percentage

**Pass Rate Formula:**
```excel
=Pass / (Pass + Fail)
```
- Divides pass count by total
- Result: Pass rate percentage

### Picking Tasks Sheet
**Actual Time Formula:**
```excel
=(End Time - Start Time) * 24 * 60
```
- Calculates time difference in minutes

**Efficiency Formula:**
```excel
=Target Time / Actual Time
```
- Divides target by actual
- Result: Efficiency percentage (>100% = faster than target)

### Order Volumes Sheet
**Return Rate Formula:**
```excel
=Cancelled / Total Orders
```
- Divides cancelled by total
- Result: Return rate percentage

### Inventory Mismatch Sheet
**Variance Formula:**
```excel
=Physical Count - System Count
```
- Calculates difference
- Result: Positive or negative variance

**Variance Percentage Formula:**
```excel
=(Physical Count - System Count) / System Count
```
- Calculates percentage difference
- Result: Variance as percentage

### Other Sheets
- **Bash Queries Response** - Query logging with timestamps
- **Employee Training** - Training status tracking
- **Employee Performance** - Performance metrics
