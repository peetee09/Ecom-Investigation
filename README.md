## 🔧 How It Works

### Dashboard (index.html + app.js)
- Pure JavaScript implementation
- Real-time data simulation
- LocalStorage for data persistence
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop

### Excel Generation (generate_excel.js)
- Uses SheetJS (xlsx) library from CDN
- Generates Excel files client-side in the browser
- Creates 12 fully formatted sheets
- Includes formulas and sample data
- Downloads automatically when generated

### Legacy Python Support
The original Python script (`generate_ecom_tracking_system.py`) is still included for users who prefer Python, but it's **completely optional**. The JavaScript version provides identical functionality without requiring Python installation.
